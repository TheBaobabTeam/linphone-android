\subsection{System Overview}

The system we are working on is called Linphone. We are supposed to add an additional functionality  to an already existing project.The main aim of the functionality we are developing in the Linphone project is to allow a group of users to be able to communicate or exchange messages with each other. This functionality is achieved by creating a group chat where there will be an interface that allows those messages to be exchanged and viewed. A  participant can send messages and pictures to a group, send voice recordings,update the group picture and change the  group name.
A participant can become an administrator in the group -  usually this is the person who creates the group ,who is 
responsible for adding and  removing other participants.\\

\subsubsection{Network}
The linphone application requires registration to a SIP provider before you can operate it. This ensures that you have a SIP address which is a Uniform Resource Identifier also known as a URI which is represented in the form user@domain.tld.
