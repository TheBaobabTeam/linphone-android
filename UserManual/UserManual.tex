\subsection{System Overview}

The system we are working on is called Linphone. We are are adding additional functionality to an already existing project. The main aim of the functionality we are developing in the Linphone project is to allow a group of users to be able to communicate or exchange messages with each other. \\
This functionality is achieved by creating a group chat were there will be an interface that allows those messages to be exchanged and viewed. A  participant can send messages and pictures to a group, send voice recordings,update the group picture and change the  group name. \\
A participant can become an administrator in the group -  usually this is the person who creates the group ,who is 
responsible for adding and  removing other participants.\\


\subsection{System Configuration}

%Ephiphania Edit Here
\subsubsection{Equipment}
An Android phone is a smartphone that runs on Google's open-source Android operating system. There are a number of different manufacturers that make Android phones, namely HUAWEI, LG, ASUS, acer, Virgin mobile, Samsung, Motorola, Sony and many more.\\

\subsubsection{Network}
The linphone application requires registration to a SIP provider before you can operate it. The provider ensures that you have a SIP address which is a Uniform Resource Identifier also known as a URI which is represented in the form user@domain.tld. \\

\end{figure}
\end{center}

Linphone.org hosts a free SIP service which allows users to make audio or video calls using SIP addresses under the domain sip.linphone.org. \\
When creating your sip address like sip:baobab@sip.linphone.org you simple use the form provided on http://www.linphone.org/free-sip-service.html and your friends can communicate with you by simply making use of the sip address.

Troubleshooting, FAQ & Problems

Connection problems
I try to phone to my friend <sip:toto@example.com>, but nothing happens, no ring, nothing
at all.
You must verify that linphone uses the network interface that connects you to the
internet (or to the network where calls should go). Use the property box, section
Network, to select the correct network interface.
In other case, the person you are contacting may be not reachable at the moment...

Audio problems
Linphone seems to connect to the remote sip url, it rings, but when the callee answers,
nothing happens and we can’t hear each other.

• Most people get problems because they don’t choose the correct network interface
in the property box, section network. 

In other cases, it will fail.
• First rise up playback and recording level.
• If the voice is sometines cutted, you can modify parameter RTP->jitter
compensation in the property box to greater values to avoid this. But it increases the
delay transmission.

FAQ
How do I use Linphone Calling?
Linphone Calling lets you call your friends and family using Linphone for free, even if they’re in another country. Currently, Linphone Calling is available on Android.
Linphone Calling uses your phone’s Internet connection rather than your cellular plan’s voice minutes. Data charges may apply.
Please note: you can’t access 10111 and other emergency service numbers through Linphone. You must make alternative communication arrangements to make emergency calls.

Place a Linphone call
To make a WhatsApp call, simply open the chat with the person you want to call and tap on the phone button on top.
Recieving a Linphone call
When someone calls you, you will see an incoming WhatsApp call screen. You can tap and slide the green button to answer the call, or slide the red button to decline the call. Alternatively, you can tap on the message icon on the call screen to decline the call with a quick message.

What is a Group Chat?
The Group Chat feature lets you chat with up to 50 people at once. It is a great way to stay in touch with your family, friends and colleagues. In addition to the maximum number of people you can add to a group, there are a few more things to keep in mind about Group Chat:
There is no limit to the number of groups you can create.
Every group has one or more admins. Only admins can add or remove participants.
Only admins can make other participants admins.
If the last admin leaves the group, a new admin will be randomly assigned.
You can always control your own participation in a Group Chat, by staying in or leaving the group when you wish. Remember that only group admins have the ability to add participants. If you have any questions about being added to a group, or prefer not to be added, please speak to a group admin.
If you have blocked a contact, you will still receive messages this contact sends into any group you have in common. Likewise, they will still receive messages you send to those groups.



9. Bugs reporting and suggestions
