# linphone-android
A clone from the linphone project (https://github.com/BelledonneCommunications/linphone-android). The current linphone production release does not have the group chat abilities found in most commercial IM apps like WhatApp and Viber. It is for that reason that this repository was created. The main purpose of the repository is to develop group chat for the linphone app.
